## Upload library to PIPY

### **Step 1: Update Version Number**
#### **If using `setup.py`**
Edit `setup.py` and increment the `version` field:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="my_library",  
    version="0.1.1",  # Increase the version number
    packages=find_packages(),
)
```
If the previous version was `0.1.0`, change it to `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.

#### **If using `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517/518)**
Edit `pyproject.toml` and update the version:
```toml
[tool.setuptools]
version = "0.1.1"  # Increment version
```

---

### **Step 2: Delete Old Distribution Files**
Remove old package files from the `dist/` folder:
```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
```

---

### **Step 3: Rebuild the Package**
Rebuild the package with the new version:

For `setup.py`:
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

For `pyproject.toml` (if using PEP 517/518):
```bash
python -m build
```

---

### **Step 4: Re-upload the New Version**
Now upload again using Twine:
```bash
twine upload dist/*
```
